## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the IBERIA L.A.E. Organization for accounts where Iberia's businesses can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects.

Multiple user accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account, which owns the repositories.

# Git and Github

We hardly recommend you to start trought these labs, from [Learning Labs](https://lab.github.com/) if you a re new to Git and/or Github:

- [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
- [First Week on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github)

# Innersource

Another important concept of this organization is [Innersource](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/) and how IBERIA L.A.E. implements it:

- [Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource)

# Principles and Standards

The big rules that govern software engineering decisions, and the the mandatory technical specifications are exposed in a pair of repositories:

- [software-engineering--principles](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--principles)
- [software-engineering--standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--standards)

Apart of them, there are several technical respositories owned by [Software Engineering team](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/software-engineering) but opened for contribution as getting started and best practices that can be found with the searcher using appropiate tags like "best-practices", "getting-started" or "software-engineering".

Any doubt, problem, .. can be addressed to the [Software Engineering team](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/software-engineering) starting a [discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions).
